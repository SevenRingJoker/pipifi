                            Your time is limited, so don't live for others. Don't be limited by dogma, don't live in the minds of others. Don't let other people's opinions influence your inner voice. The most important thing is to bravely follow your own mind and intuition. Only your own mind and intuition know your true thoughts. Everything else is secondary.
